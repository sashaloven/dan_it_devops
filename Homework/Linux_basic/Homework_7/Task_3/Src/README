I install nginx and monit service.
Create a file /etc/monit/conf.d/nginx with :

check host nginx with address 127.0.0.1
    if failed port 80 protocol http then alert
    if failed port 80 protocol http then restart
    if failed port 80 protocol http for 7 times within 7 cycles then unmonitor
    start program = "/usr/sbin/service nginx start"
    stop program  = "/usr/sbin/service nginx stop"

Which monitoring nginx service on port 80 and try to reload 7 times.

I change file /etc/monit/monitrc 
add: 
set httpd port 2812
use address localhost
allow localhost

for web interface

restart monit. Everything worker, so I stop nginx service and add output screenshot. Its trying to restart but it doesnt worked.
