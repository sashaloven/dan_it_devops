🛡️ Prevent anyone from writing to it except to append new content to the end of the file.


📝 Task_2: Disk Utilization Monitoring
📜 Script Creation and Setup

1. Create the Script:

	- Write a script that checks the disk utilization of the / volume.
	- The script should:
	   - Check the current disk usage percentage.
	   - Compare the current usage with a configurable threshold value (X).
	   - If the usage exceeds X%, the script should:
	      - Write a warning message to the log file: /var/log/disk.log.
	      - Include the current usage percentage and a timestamp.

2. Set Up Crontab:

	- Configure a cron job to run the script at a desired frequency (e.g., daily or hourly).
	- In the crontab configuration, ensure the threshold value X% is easily configurable.

3. Log File Location:

	- Ensure that the log file /var/log/disk.log is created if it doesn't exist.
	- The log file should contain entries like:
	   - Warning: Disk usage exceeded X%
	   - Timestamp of when the check was performed.
