📝 Tasks: Random Number Guessing Game and SSH Configuration

---
	🎲 Random Number Guessing Game

1. Generate a Random Number:

	- Create a script that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and stores it in a variable.

2. User Interaction:

	- Ask the user to guess the number.
	  - If the guess is correct:
	    - 🎉 Print "Congratulations! You guessed the right number." and exit.

	  - If the guess is incorrect:
		Provide feedback:
		   - 🔼 "Too high" if the guess is greater than the random number.
		   - 🔽 "Too low" if the guess is less than the random number.

	- Allow the user up to 5 attempts to guess the number.

3. Endgame Scenarios:

	- If the user fails after 5 attempts:
	  - ❌ Print "Sorry, you've run out of attempts. The correct number was [the correct number]." and exit.

	🔐 SSH Configuration

1. 👤 User Creation:

	- Create a user named "john" with a default home folder.

2. 🛠️ Configure SSH Server (Port 2222):

	- Install and configure an SSH server:
	- Change the listening port to 2222.
	- Restrict root access.
	- Disallow password authentication.
	- Configure the server to only allow connections for john using an SSH key.

3. 🔍 Parallel SSH Debug Server (Port 3333):

	- Run an SSH server in debug mode:
	- Listen on port 3333.
	- Allow connections via passwords and SSH keys.
	- Permit connections for all users (except root).

4. 🔗 Connection Tests:

	- Attempt to connect to both servers:
	- Use john and an SSH key for port 2222.
	- Use a password or SSH key for port 3333.

5. 📋 Verification:

- Check and document the status of both SSH servers.
