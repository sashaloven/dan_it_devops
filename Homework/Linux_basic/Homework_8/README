📝 Task: Vagrant Project Setup with Nginx

1. Create and Initialize a Vagrant Project:

	- 🛠️ Create a new Vagrant project.
	- 📦 Ensure it is an Ubuntu-based project.

2. Configure Vagrant File:

	- 🖥️ Set up Vagrantfile to spin up a single virtual machine.
	- 🌐 Configure the virtual machine with a public network.

3. Install and Configure Nginx:

	- 🛠️ Use provisioning to install nginx on the virtual machine.
	- 🔧 Modify the port using 'sed' so that nginx runs on port 82 (instead of the default port 80).

4. Access the Nginx Page:

	- 🌍 Open your host machine's browser and go to http://<your-vm-ip>:82.
	- 🎉 You should see the "Welcome to nginx" page (or a custom welcome page if you create one!).
