	1. Booting the Linux system 

1. BIOS/UEFI Initialization - main functions include initializing hardware components, check hardware errors and then locating the boot loader.

2. Boot loader: MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (GUID Partition Table)

3. GRUB for Linux (for example)
Its has a 1_1.5_2 stages - responsible for loading the Linux kernel into memory. Provide a selection for choose a different kernel versions or operating system (Windows - Linux...) 

4. Kernel Initialization: 
The boot loader loads the Linux kernel into memory and hands over control to it. After its initialiying hardware and drivers.

5. Init(older systems) or systemd:
The initial process started by the kernel is the init system. The init system runs initialization scripst to set up user space enviroment.


	2.How to view system logs
System logs are stored in files in /var/log dir.
You can view logs with tool 'journalctl or dmesg' (easy way) or view direct files, like 'var/log/syslog with command tail -f (live) or another command and use 'grep' for help find logs what you need


	3.RW perm
 -rw------- perm - read and write for owner. Groups or users cant do nothing with file (no root).
To add 'x' you can use 2 way:
1. chmod u+x 'filename'
2. chmod 700 'filename'


	4. Difference between apt and dpkg
Both are essentional tools in Debian-based systems. 'apt' ease of use by managing dependencies and interact with repo, 'dpkg' more direct control over individual .deb packages
