📝 Task: Infrastructure, Database, and Application Setup with Vagrant				     |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🖥️ Subtask I - Infrastructure

1. Describe Two Virtual Machines (VMs):

	- 🛠️ Create two VMs using a Vagrantfile:
	   - APP_VM: for deploying the application.
	   - DB_VM: for hosting the database.

2. Networking Configuration:

	- 🌐 Preferably use private networking for easy communication between the VMs.
	- 🚪 If not using private networking, ensure that APP_VM forwards port 8080 to the host.

3. VM Operating System:

	- ✅ Choose either CentOS or Ubuntu for the VMs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🗄️ Subtask II - Database

1. Provisioning MySQL on DB_VM:

	- 🛠️ Use a provisioning script to install MySQL and any necessary dependencies on DB_VM.

2. MySQL Configuration:

	- 🔒 Customize the MySQL instance to accept connections only from your private network subnet.

3. MySQL User and Database Setup:

	- 🔑 Create a non-root MySQL user (codename DB_USER) and set a password (DB_PASS) using host environment variables.
	- 🗂️ Create a database (codename DB_NAME) and grant DB_USER full privileges to the database.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💻 Subtask III - Application

1. Create Application User on APP_VM:

	- 👨 Create a non-root user (codename APP_USER) to run the application on APP_VM.

2. Provisioning Application Dependencies:

	- 🛠️ Use a provisioner to install Java JDK, git, and any necessary dependencies on APP_VM.

3. Clone the Repository:

	- 📂 Clone the project repository into the working directory (codename PROJECT_DIR).

4. Build the Application with Maven:

	- ⚙️ Use Maven (via the wrapper script mvnw) to run tests and package the application.
	- ✅ If successful, find the .jar package in the $PROJECT_DIR/target folder.

5. Move the .jar File:

	- 📂 Move the .jar file to APP_USER’s home directory (codename APP_DIR).

6. Set Environment Variables:

	- 📝 Set the following environment variables on APP_VM (preferably using the same environment variables passed from the host machine as in DB_VM):
	   - DB_HOST: IP of DB_VM
           - DB_PORT: MySQL port (default 3306)
           - DB_NAME: MySQL database name
           - DB_USER: MySQL username
           - DB_PASS: MySQL password
           - Run the Application:

7. 🏃 Run the application with APP_USER using the following command:

	> java -jar your-app.jar

8. Verify the Application:

	- 🌐 Open your browser and visit http://$APP_VM_IP:8080 to see the PetClinic application running.
